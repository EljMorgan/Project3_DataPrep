# Project3_DataPrep

The goals of this project is to apply the data preparation knowledge and to train more in Python and SQL.

# Technical Requirements
## The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

Import the provided data using Pandas.
Examine the data for potential issues (missing data, data inconsistency, outliers, duplicates etc).
Apply the different cleaning and manipulation techniques.
Explain all the approaches you are going to use (why and how)
Produce a Python code that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
Export clean version of your data into CSV file using Pandas.
Export clean data into MySQL using Pandas.
Prepare at least 3 tables analyzing the dataset in MySQL. Consider using group by statement for it.


# Our project organizatiion
## Step by step (SQL part still in progress a cause limited timing)
1. Starting from analyzing data
2. Rounding numeric values till 2 after coma
3. Looking for columns names issue
4. Looking for missing values
5. Solving missing values issue by "detective mode" to copmlete it the most fulfill way
6. Searching for repeatable values and duplicates
7. Finding outliers
8. Visualization by every outlier and common graph
9. Searching for explicable anomalies
10. Deciding to clean data outliers by dropping the rows
11. Addins bins for profit measure in dataset
12. Trying some interesting calculation 
13. Exporting cleaned data in csv
